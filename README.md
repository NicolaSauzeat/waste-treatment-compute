# waste-treatment-compute

## Goal 
This project tends to develop a NLP architecture with 4 models to compute similarity score between web indexing content and HS nomenclature 
(Harmonized System which is the international classification for manufacturing product)
This project to re-create experimentations for an article that will be publish soon !

## Input Files
Input files are stored here : https://drive.open.studio/s/sGw7eEEp89L3EyH
You have just to replace Resultats/in by theses folders

## Output Files
Output files will be disponible after the final version of this project

## Architecture
- A dockerfile permits to install all packages needed to run this project
- The requirements.txt file store all version for this project

- The main file is the central manager of differents architectures and options (trained and compute the model)
- The training file store all function that permits to preprocess data
- The compute model permits to train models, store it and compute all similarity score. Metrics will coming soon
